    "Use a double dueling DQN to train an agent that can achieve a superhuman level at the famous Atari Breakout game (\"ALE/Breakout-v5\"). The observations are images. To simplify the task, you should convert them to grayscale (i.e., average over the channels axis) then crop them and downsample them, so theyâ€™re just large enough to play, but not more. An individual image does not tell you which way the ball and the paddles are going, so you should merge two or three consecutive images to form each state. Lastly, the DQN should be composed mostly of convolutional layers."
